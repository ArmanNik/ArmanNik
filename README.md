Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Arman

I have five years of professional experience freelancing as a web developer and designer, building websites for clients, and exploring the newest technologies in my many side projects. 

I'm mostly self-taught, I love tinkering with new technologies, and learning new stuff. I rely a lot on youtube tutorials, documentation, and well...google. But I discovered that the best way to learn a new coding-related skill is by building something with it, which somehow always happens when I have the tightest deadlines, but so far I have always come through.


# Technical skills
### Strong understanding of:

HTML5, CSS, SASS, BEM, Tailwind, Responsive Design, Javascript (ES6), Node, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vue Js & Frameworks(Gridsome, Nuxt), Git, Googling, Figma, Adobe Suite( photoshop,  illustrator, ...), SEO


### Essential understanding of (aka "I'll have to google a lot of stuff"):

Typescript, PostgreSQL, Jest, Cypress, Python


# Noteworthy projects:

### SuperMetaPets (Jan 2022)

https://supermetapets.com

I created a small social network in one month, with password-less login/sign-up through a magic link or OAuth, and user data submission functionality. Built with Sveltekit, Supabase, daisyUI (tailwind framework), and hosted on Vercel.   

On the site fans of the game "Super Auto Pets" can share strategies on how to win. It got more than 2500 views in the first three days and 60 sing-ups.

I made it because I got Covid on Christmas and was stuck at home, and really bored.


### AutoGreenCheck (Oct/Nov 2021)

https://app.autogreencheck.com

https://autogreencheck.com

A Sveltekit+Supabase+Stripe+Tailwind+Netlify attempt at building a Saas aimed at small businesses. The  site allows users to scans their covid greenpass and uses it as a badge to enter the workplace and uses that data to create time-cards. 

All the information contained in the greenpass QR code is processed by a Sveltekit endpoint, and only the essential information is saved on the database. The project was developed in three weeks, shortly after the Italian government made the greenpass mandatory to enter the workplace. Due to the ever-changing laws, and low adoption, it didn't live past a couple of months but it was a good learning experience.

p.s. the registrations are suspended at the moment.


### VisualVessel(2019)

https://visualvessel.com 

My somewhat outdated static site dedicated to my freelancing business. It's built with Nuxt 2, Sass (the design is custom made), and hosted on Netlify.

Some of my other projects can be found on it, they are all built with Vue or one of its frameworks.
