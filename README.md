Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Arman

I have five years of professional experience freelancing as a web developer and designer, building websites for clients, and exploring the newest technologies in my many side projects. 

I'm mostly self-taught, I love tinkering with new technologies, and learning new stuff. I rely a lot on youtube tutorials, documentation, and well...google. But I discovered that the best way to learn a new coding-related skill is by building something with it, which somehow always happens when I have the tightest deadlines, but so far I have always come through.


## Technical skills
### Strong understanding of:

HTML5, CSS, SASS, BEM, Tailwind, Responsive Design, Javascript (ES6), Node, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vue Js & Frameworks(Gridsome, Nuxt), Git, Googling, Figma, Adobe Suite( photoshop,  illustrator, ...), SEO


### Essential understanding of (aka "I'll have to google a lot of stuff"):

Typescript, PostgreSQL, Jest, Cypress, Python
